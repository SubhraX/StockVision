Absolutely! Here's a **well-designed, user-friendly `README.md`** for your `StockVision` project — assuming it's a stock price prediction app using ML models (TensorFlow/Sklearn), possibly FastAPI, and has large models managed via Git LFS:

---

````md
# 📈 StockVision

> A powerful, modern stock market prediction app built with machine learning and deep learning. Predict future stock prices using historical data and technical indicators — all wrapped in an easy-to-use web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔮 BiLSTM-based deep learning models for price prediction
- 🧠 Scikit-learn preprocessing (e.g., MinMaxScaler)
- 📊 Interactive web interface using FastAPI + Uvicorn
- 💾 Large model files managed via Git LFS
- ⚙️ Fully local setup — no data leaks

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Git (with LFS enabled)
- `pip` (or `pipenv` / `poetry`)

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository** and pull LFS files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhraX/StockVision.git
   cd StockVision
   git lfs install
   git lfs pull
````

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Downloads and processes historical stock data
2. Scales input features using `MinMaxScaler`
3. Feeds data into an LSTM neural network (TensorFlow)
4. Outputs predicted prices
5. Visualizes results through a browser-based UI

---

## 🖥️ Running the App

Start the local server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## 🧩 Git LFS Info

This project uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for large model files (e.g., `.h5`, `.pkl`). Make sure you’ve installed and initialized it:

```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```
